🕹️ As a teenager in high school, I found myself fascinated with the world of gaming. I spent countless hours creating a mod for Counterstrike Source and managing a server to host it. Eventually, I even created a website where a community formed around my mod, which ended up being self-sustaining. It was a fantastic learning experience that sparked my interest in tech and coding.

💼 After high school, I worked as a retail manager, leading a team of over 80 employees. During my time there, I discovered that I had a passion for coaching and training, and I enjoyed helping others develop their skills and grow in their roles.

👨‍💻 However, my true passion was in coding, so I decided to pursue a career in tech. I enrolled in App Academy, where I learned various programming languages and technologies. I immersed myself in the world of coding and was eager to learn as much as I could.

🐍 Some of the languages I'm proficient in include Python and JavaScript, and I'm comfortable working with HTML5, CSS, and React. I also have experience with database management and have worked with technologies such as SQLAlchemy, Flask, Sequelize, and Postgres SQL.

💡 As a developer, I'm always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I love solving problems and finding creative solutions to complex issues. I'm passionate about creating products that have a positive impact on people's lives and making a difference through technology.

🌟 Overall, I'm a hardworking, dedicated, and passionate individual who is excited about the opportunities that the tech industry has to offer. I'm always looking to expand my skill set and grow as a developer, and I'm excited to see where my journey in tech takes me next!
